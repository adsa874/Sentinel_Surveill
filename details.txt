Below is a **clean, founder-to-founder PRD**—tight, technical, non-bureaucratic—written so that someone like **Tobi Lütke** can immediately see *what to build, what not to build, and why this matters*.

# PRD — Edge-First Location Intelligence & Security System

**Working name:** Sentinel (placeholder)
**Author:** Aditya Saboo
**Audience:** Principal engineer / founder-builder
**Status:** MVP exploration → near-term implementation
**Philosophy:** Ship a real system that runs 24/7 in the physical world

---

## 1. Problem Statement

Most “security” systems either:

* Record everything but understand nothing, or
* Require expensive, closed hardware and vendor lock-in

At the same time, smartphones are:

* Powerful edge compute devices
* Cheap, ubiquitous, and replaceable
* Already deployed in factories, sites, offices, and properties

**The gap:**
There is no simple, software-defined system that turns *any Android phone* into a **persistent, intelligent vantage point** that:

* Understands who and what passes through a location
* Recognizes recurring individuals
* Tracks vehicles and number plates
* Logs meaningful events instead of raw footage

---

## 2. Product Vision

A **downloadable Android binary** (no app store dependency) that:

* Runs 24/7 on a plugged-in phone
* Observes a fixed physical scene
* Performs continuous, on-device AI analysis
* Converts reality into **structured events**
* Enables attendance, security, and operational intelligence

**Mental model:**

> A software-defined security camera with memory.

---

## 3. Non-Goals (Explicit)

To keep the MVP sharp, we are **not** building:

* A consumer app
* Cloud video streaming
* iOS support
* Facial emotion analysis
* Public identity search
* Heavy UI / configuration screens
* App Store compliance flows

This is **industrial software**, not a marketplace app.

---

## 4. Target Deployment Environments

* Construction sites
* Factories & workshops
* Office entrances
* Resorts / hospitality back-of-house
* Warehouses
* Gated properties

Assumption:

* Device is **fixed in place**
* Device is **always plugged in**
* Device is **owned by the operator**

---

## 5. Core Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Installation & Execution

* Delivered as a **sideloadable APK**
* Installed directly from a website or internal link
* Runs as a **foreground service**
* Automatically restarts on reboot
* Explicitly disables OS battery optimizations

**Success criteria:**
Once installed, the phone behaves like an appliance.

---

### 5.2 Continuous Visual Perception (Edge)

The system must continuously process camera input and maintain internal state.

#### Detect:

* Humans
* Vehicles (cars, bikes, trucks)

#### Track:

* Unique individuals across frames
* Unique vehicles across frames

Tracking must prevent duplicate counting and allow duration measurement.

---

### 5.3 Face Recognition (Employees)

The system must support **closed-set face recognition**.

#### Enrollment

* Admin enrolls employees locally or via backend
* Multiple face samples per employee
* Store **face embeddings**, not raw images

#### Recognition

* Identify enrolled employees when they appear
* Log:

  * First seen
  * Last seen
  * Total presence duration

**Primary use case:**
Attendance & access logging.

---

### 5.4 Person Re-Identification (Non-Employees)

For all other individuals:

* Assign anonymous, persistent IDs
* Recognize the *same person returning later*
* No naming or identity resolution required

This enables:

* Loitering detection
* Repeat visits
* Pattern recognition

---

### 5.5 Vehicle & Number Plate Recognition

* Detect vehicles
* Attempt license plate detection
* OCR plate numbers where possible
* Track vehicle presence duration

Accuracy is **best-effort**, not mission-critical in MVP.

---

## 6. Event-First System Design (Key Principle)

The system does **not** think in video.

It thinks in **events**.

### Example Events

* Person entered scene
* Person exited scene
* Same person returned after X minutes
* Employee first entry of day
* Vehicle stopped for longer than threshold
* Unusual activity window

Each event is:

* Timestamped
* Attributed
* Stored
* Queryable

Raw video is secondary and optional.

---

## 7. AI & Technical Architecture

### 7.1 On-Device (Primary Intelligence)

Runs continuously on the phone:

* Object detection (people, vehicles)
* Face detection
* Face embedding generation
* Tracking (people & vehicles)
* Temporary state & buffers

Design principle:

> The phone should still be useful even if the network is down.

---

### 7.2 Backend (Secondary Intelligence)

* Receives event streams
* Stores logs
* Aggregates attendance
* Enables dashboards & alerts
* Optional LLM-based summarization

The backend **never** needs raw video for core functionality.

---

## 8. Data Model (Conceptual)

### Person (Anonymous)

* internal_id
* first_seen
* last_seen
* visit_count

### Employee

* employee_id
* face_embeddings[]
* attendance_records[]

### Vehicle

* internal_id
* plate_text (optional)
* confidence
* durations

### Event

* type
* subject_id
* timestamp
* metadata

---

## 9. Performance Requirements (MVP)

* Must run **24/7 without crashing**
* Thermal throttling handled gracefully
* Frame sampling acceptable (not every frame)
* False positives acceptable within reason
* Deterministic behavior preferred over cleverness

Reliability > novelty.

---

## 10. Configuration Philosophy

Minimal configuration.

* Fixed camera
* Fixed scene
* Sensible defaults
* Optional remote config later

The system should “just work” once installed.

---

## 11. Security & Trust Model (Pragmatic)

* System is deployed by owner
* No adversarial threat model in MVP
* No consumer trust UI required
* Assume physical control of device

This is **infrastructure software**, not social software.

---

## 12. Why This Is Interesting (Founder Context)

* Turns commodity hardware into infrastructure
* Edge-first, not cloud-first
* Avoids App Store economics entirely
* Strong real-world feedback loops
* Naturally extensible into:

  * Attendance systems
  * Security
  * Operations analytics
  * Smart city primitives

This is a **real-world systems problem**, not a UI problem.

---

## 13. MVP Definition of “Done”

The MVP is successful if:

* A phone can be mounted, plugged in, and forgotten
* It logs people, vehicles, and attendance accurately enough
* The same individual can be recognized across time
* Daily summaries can be generated from event logs
* The system runs for weeks without intervention

---

## 14. Open Questions (Intentionally Left)

* Centralized vs fully local identity matching
* Long-term embedding retention strategy
* Hardware standardization
* Multi-camera correlation

These are **Phase 2 problems**.

---

## 15. Closing Note to Implementer

This product should feel less like an “app” and more like:

* Firmware
* Infrastructure
* A daemon that observes reality

If done right, this becomes a **primitive** others can build on.

---

If you want, next I can:

* Rewrite this as a **one-page founder memo**
* Produce a **technical architecture diagram**
* Define **exact model choices & thresholds**
* Draft a **v0 dashboard spec**

Just tell me the next artifact you want.
